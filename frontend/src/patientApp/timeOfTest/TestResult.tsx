            Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Make
            sure to follow CDC guidelines for people who are recovering at home
            and their caregivers, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.</li>
            <li>
              Self isolate for 10 full days after symptoms first appeared (or
              starting the day after you had your test, if you have no
              symptoms).
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are self isolating at home where others live, use a
              separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if
              possible). Clean any shared rooms as needed, to avoid transmitting
              the virus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,
              especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going
              to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
            </li>
            <li>
              If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand
              sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a supply of clean, disposable face masks. Everyone, no matter
              their COVID-19 diagnosis, should wear face masks while in the
              home.

            results and follow up testing may be needed. Continue social
